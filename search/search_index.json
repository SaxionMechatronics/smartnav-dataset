The data was collected as part of our projects that address the challenges of autonomous navigation in industries where autonomous robots are needed. This data was mainly recorded for the evaluation of Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) algorithms; however, it can be used generally for vision or LiDAR-based SLAM and fusion algorithms. </p>"},{"location":"#downloads","title":"Downloads","text":"Seq.
