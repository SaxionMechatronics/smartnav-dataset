The data was collected as part of our projects that address the challenges of autonomous navigation in industries where autonomous robots are needed. This data was mainly recorded for the evaluation of Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) algorithms; however, it can be used generally for vision or LiDAR-based SLAM and fusion algorithms. </p>"},{"location":"#commands","title":"Commands","text":"<ul> <li><code>mkdocs new [dir-name]</code> - Create a new project.</li> <li><code>mkdocs serve</code> - Start the live-reloading docs server.</li> <li><code>mkdocs build</code> - Build the documentation site.</li> <li><code>mkdocs -h</code> - Print help message and exit.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#project-layout","title":"Project layout","text":"<pre><code>mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.\ndocs/\n    index.md  # The documentation homepage.\n    ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.\n</code></pre>"}]}
